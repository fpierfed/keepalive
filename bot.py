        # Note: it looks like types in Pincer are not very consistent. For
        # this reason we establish the following standard:
        #   * Thread IDs are stiored as str but are used as ints. The reason
        #     being that Discord does not allow us to pass Thread IDs as ints.
        #   * Whenever we pass a Thread ID to Pincer, we pass an int.
        #
        #   * Guild/Server IDs are stored as ints since they are never passed
        #     to us from a user via Discord.
        #   * Guild/Server IDs are always passed as ints to Pincer.
